## Who Am I
Hi.</br>
My name is Rich.</br>
I love all things math, science and engineering.</br>

## Early Years
I was born in California but grew up in Wyoming, moving there when I was only 5.  After working my way through K-12 in Casper, I ended up at the University of Wyoming where I managed to graduate with a degree in Math.  The first book I ever remember reading was Streams of Silver, the second book in a fantasy trilogy by RA Salvator.  If memory serves (which it probably doesn't) I got it at RIF in 5th grade.  Obviously, I read other books before that -- Bunnicula maybe -- but that is the book that stands out in my mind.  I ended up buying dozens of Forgotten Realms books over the years.  Those and almost all of the Crichton books.  Jurassic Park was sooooo good.  However, in my opinion, the most influential book was Chaos by James Gleick.  That book gave me a love for the beauty of math that still motivates me today.

Sometime around 1986 I was introduced to computer programming.  My first game Hotel d'Cheapo was completed in '88.  It was a text based adventure with only one pathway to success.  You had to abstain from eating the bread you found in the trashcan later using the mold it to synthesize penicillin to save you from some sort of disease.  I think there might have been 4 or 5 different decisions.  In my early teens one of my parents' coworkers gave me a book on C.  Since I didn't have a compiler I had to program in my mind.  It's not ideal. When I was 16 my parents got me a copy of Borland C++ 4.5.  It still might be the best gift I've ever received.

## Siblings
I have two brothers and a sister.

## The Land
This was such a formative part of my life I'm not entirely sure where to start.  When I was about 12 years old my dad asked us if we wanted to raise animals.  I don't know who would say no to that.  Watch out kids, it's a trap!  Anyway, we spent the next four years raising ourselves in the style of Lord of the Flies.  When I could finally drive we no longer had to stay out there and James and I ended up doing most of the work on our own.

## Employment
### Critique
This lead me to a stint at an oil field, a couple of months in Mexico, and an interlude in San Diego.  When I returned to Laramie I was homeless, sleeping on couches of gracious friends before I ended up working in a carpet store.  After a few months of rollerblading and chili dogs I landed a job at Handel Information Technologies.  

### Handel
I worked there for seven years before I was unceremoniously fired.  I did get some severence so that was nice.  I used the money to start Azzl Software.  

### Azzl
After getting more consulting work than I could handle I ended up creating a legal entity.  As luck would have it, I ended up taking a job with Propel Labs instead.  

### Propel
After 4 years of grueling but rewarding work, Esher happened.  Soon we moved back to Laramie and a couple of years of commuting to Fort Collins later I went part time.  This gave me free time to work on Neowire.  

### Neowire
Not quite a year after going part time Neowire was almost making enough money to live on.  Ten months later, we are now making enough money to pay our taxes (hopefully).  I also decided I needed a place for my mind to wander.  Hence, richmiles.xyz.

## Fatherhood
I don't remember much about the pregnancy and frankly I no longer remember much about the early months, but I tell myself to "never forget".  The first two months were grueling, though in hindsight it really is a fraction of the time I've spent with Esher.  For me, 6 months was an inflection point.  The older he gets the more I love him.
