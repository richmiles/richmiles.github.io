## Who Am I
Hi.
My name is Rich.
I love all things math and science.
Almost as much as my family.

## Early Years
I was born in California but grew up in Wyoming, moving there when I was only 5.  After working my way through K-12 in Casper, I ended up at the University of Wyoming where I managed to graduate with a degree in Math.  The first book I ever remember reading was Streams of Silver, the second book in a fantasy trilogy by RA Salvator.  If memory serves (which it probably doesn't) I got it at RIF in 5th grade.  Obviously, I read other books before that -- Bunnicula maybe -- but that is the book that stands out in my mind.  I ended up buying dozens of Forgotten Realms books over the years.  Those and almost all of the Crichton books.  Jurassic Park was sooooo good.  However, in my opinion, the most influential book was Chaos by James Gleick.  That book gave me a love for the beauty of math that still motivates me today.

## Employment

This lead me to a stint at an oil field, a couple of months in Mexico, and an interlude in San Diego.  When I returned to Laramie I was homeless, sleeping on couches of gracious friends before I ended up working in a carpet store.  After a few months of rollerblading and chili dogs I landed a job at Handel Information Technologies.  I worked there for seven years before I was unceremoniously fired.  I did get some severence so that was nice.  I used the money to start Azzl Software.  After getting more consulting work than I could handle I ended up creating a legal entity.  As luck would have it, I ended up taking a job with Propel Labs instead.  After 4 years of grueling but rewarding work, Esher happened.  Soon we moved back to Laramie and a couple of years of commuting to Fort Collins later I went part time.  This gave me free time to work on Neowire.  Not quite a year after going part time Neowire was almost making enough money to live on.  Ten months later, we are now making enough money to pay our taxes (hopefully).  I also decided I needed a place for my mind to wander.  Hence, richmiles.xyz.
