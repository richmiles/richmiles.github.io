## Fatherhood
I don't remember much about the pregnancy and frankly I no longer remember much about the early months, but I tell myself to "never forget".  The first two months were grueling, though in hindsight it really is a fraction of the time I've spent with Esher.  For me, 6 months was an inflection point.  The older he gets the more I love him.
