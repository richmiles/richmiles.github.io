## Employment
### Casper's Family Dining
As soon as I was old enough to work, I started as a dishwasher and busboy at Casper's Family Dining.

### Critique
This lead me to a stint at an oil field, a couple of months in Mexico, and an interlude in San Diego.  When I returned to Laramie I was homeless, sleeping on couches of gracious friends before I ended up working in a carpet store.  After a few months of rollerblading and chili dogs I landed a job at Handel Information Technologies.  

### Handel
I worked there for seven years before I was unceremoniously fired.  I did get some severence so that was nice.  I used the money to start Azzl Software.  

### Azzl
After getting more consulting work than I could handle I ended up creating a legal entity.  As luck would have it, I ended up taking a job with Propel Labs instead.  

### Propel
After 4 years of grueling but rewarding work, Esher happened.  Soon we moved back to Laramie and a couple of years of commuting to Fort Collins later I went part time.  This gave me free time to work on Neowire.  

### Neowire
Not quite a year after going part time Neowire was almost making enough money to live on.  Ten months later, we are now making enough money to pay our taxes (hopefully).
